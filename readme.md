# Bus Routing Optimization System üöçüõ§Ô∏è

## Project Overview üìä
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning-based Bus Routing Optimization System** that efficiently manages and optimizes bus routes in real-time. The solution uses predictive models to forecast demand and traffic, combined with dynamic route optimization to enhance the efficiency of public transportation.

## Project Structure üìÇ
Here's an overview of the key components of the project:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_preprocessing.py      # Data preprocessing functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demand_model.py            # LSTM model for demand prediction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ traffic_model.py           # Random Forest model for traffic prediction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ route_optimizer.py         # Dynamic route optimization logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ real_time_controller.py    # Real-time control and route updates
```

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing (`data_preprocessing.py`)**:
   - Prepares the dataset for model training and evaluation.
   - Cleans, normalizes, and structures the data to be used for demand and traffic predictions.
   - Outputs preprocessed data for further modeling.

2. **Demand Prediction Model (`demand_model.py`)**:
   - Utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict bus demand at different stops based on historical data.
   - The model learns temporal patterns in the data to forecast future demand.

3. **Traffic Prediction Model (`traffic_model.py`)**:
   - Implements a **Random Forest** model to predict traffic conditions based on features like time of day, weather, and historical traffic data.
   - Helps optimize bus schedules by considering traffic congestion.

4. **Route Optimization (`route_optimizer.py`)**:
   - Contains logic for optimizing bus routes dynamically based on real-time demand and traffic conditions.
   - Uses demand and traffic predictions to generate the most efficient routes.

5. **Real-Time Controller (`real_time_controller.py`)**:
   - Monitors live data to make adjustments to bus routes in real time.
   - Ensures that buses adapt to changing conditions to minimize delays and maximize efficiency.

## Installation & Setup üöÄ

- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `joblib`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bus-routing-optimization.git
   cd bus-routing-optimization

   - Train the LSTM model for demand prediction:
     ```bash
     python demand_model.py
     ```
   - Train the Random Forest model for traffic prediction:
     ```bash
     python traffic_model.py
     ```

3. **Run Route Optimization**:
   - Optimize routes based on predictions:
     ```bash
     python route_optimizer.py
     ```

4. **Real-Time Control**:

     ```bash
     python real_time_controller.py
     ```

## Project Flow üõ§Ô∏è
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Load historical data on bus demand, routes, and traffic conditions, and preprocess it for model training.
2. **Model Training**: Use the preprocessed data to train LSTM and Random Forest models.
3. **Route Optimization**: Generate optimized routes using predictions from the trained models.
4. **Real-Time Adjustment**: Continuously monitor real-time data to adjust bus routes dynamically.

## Future Enhancements üîÆ
- Incorporate **GPS tracking** for real-time bus locations.
- Integrate **weather data** to improve traffic predictions.
